# TestFFmpegKitSwiftUI

A simple experiment using [ffmpeg-kit](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit) with SwiftUI

This example contains the [ffmpeg-kit-full-4.5.1-macos-xcframework.zip](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit/releases/download/v4.5.1/ffmpeg-kit-full-4.5.1-macos-xcframework.zip) libraries for simplicty.

You will need to modify the `Content.swift` file to point to actual physical files

**This is intended as an eductional example - blocking the main thread is NEVER a good idea**
